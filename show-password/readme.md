Shadows, and Shadows-based ReadyThemes, ship with the Show Password extension included. This is an accessible button which allows for toggling the display of password input fields. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css` and the JavaScript is in `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.js`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS or JavaScript in `build/extensions/show-password/` and update as part of your build process.
